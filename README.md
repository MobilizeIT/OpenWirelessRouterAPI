OpenWirelessRouterAPI
=====================

The python REST API for the OpenWireless administrator gateway


1.  Run the shell command `sh sendAppToRouter`
2.  * In the router terminal, run `chmod 755 <file>` for each of the files in /www/cgi-bin/routerapi.


* This only needs to be done the first time you transfer each file.
